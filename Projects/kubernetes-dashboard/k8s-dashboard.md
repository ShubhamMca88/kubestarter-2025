# Kubernetes Dashboard: Your Web-Based Cluster Management Tool

The Kubernetes Dashboard is a web-based user interface for managing your Kubernetes cluster. It provides a graphical view of your cluster's resources and allows you to perform various actions, such as deploying applications, monitoring their health, and troubleshooting issues.

## Why Use the Kubernetes Dashboard?

* **Visualize Cluster Resources:** Get a clear overview of your nodes, pods, deployments, services, and other resources.
* **Simplified Management:** Deploy applications, scale deployments, and perform rolling updates with a user-friendly interface.
* **Monitor Application Health:** Track resource usage, view logs, and troubleshoot issues.
* **Access Control:** Manage Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies to control user access to the dashboard.
* **Troubleshooting:**  Quickly identify and diagnose problems in your applications and cluster.

## Accessing the Kubernetes Dashboard

1. **Deploy the Dashboard:** If it's not already deployed, you can install the Kubernetes Dashboard using `kubectl apply - dashbord `:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
   ```
2. **Access the Dashboard:** Use `kubectl proxy` to create a secure connection to the Dashboard: 

   ```bash
   kubectl proxy
   ```
Then, open your web browser and navigate to 

``` link 
http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/.
