# ```Replicas```

In Kubernetes, a Replica is simply a copy of a Pod.  You use Replicas to ensure your application has high availability and can handle increased traffic. If one Pod fails, another Replica takes its place, keeping your app running smoothly.

## Why are Replicas important?

* **Fault tolerance:** If a Pod crashes or a node goes down, the other Replicas keep your application running.

* **Scalability:** You can easily increase or decrease the number of Replicas to handle changes in traffic.
Zero downtime updates: Replicas allow you to update your application without any interruption to users.

## How are Replicas managed?

Replicas are managed by controllers like ReplicaSets and Deployments. These controllers ensure the desired number of Replicas are always running.
