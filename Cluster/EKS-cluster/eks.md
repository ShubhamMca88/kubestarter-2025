# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS): Managed Kubernetes in the Cloud

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run Kubernetes clusters on AWS without having to manage the control plane infrastructure.

## Why Use EKS?

* **Managed Control Plane:** AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane, including the API server, scheduler, and etcd, reducing operational overhead.
* **Scalability and Reliability:** EKS clusters are highly scalable and reliable, leveraging AWS infrastructure.
* **Integration with AWS Services:** Seamlessly integrate with other AWS services, such as IAM, VPC, and CloudWatch.
* **Security:**  Secure your clusters with AWS security features, including VPC security groups and IAM roles.
* **High Availability:**  EKS provides high availability for your Kubernetes control plane across multiple availability zones.

## EKS Key Concepts

* **Cluster:** A set of worker nodes that run your containerized applications.
* **Node Group:** A collection of EC2 instances that act as worker nodes in your EKS cluster.
* **Control Plane:** The Kubernetes control plane managed by AWS.
* **EKS Add-ons:**  Pre-built operational software that extends the functionality of your EKS cluster (e.g., CoreDNS, kube-proxy).
* **Fargate Profiles:**  Allows you to run pods on AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers.

## EKS Commands

You can manage EKS clusters using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the `eksctl` command-line tool.

### `eksctl` Commands

`eksctl` is a popular open-source tool for creating and managing EKS clusters.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `eksctl create cluster` | Create a new EKS cluster. |
| `eksctl create cluster --config-file eks-config.yaml` | Create a cluster with a specific configuration file. |
| `eksctl get cluster` | List all EKS clusters in your AWS account. |
| `eksctl delete cluster` | Delete an EKS cluster. |
| `eksctl create nodegroup` | Create a new node group in an EKS cluster. |
| `eksctl delete nodegroup` | Delete a node group. |

### AWS CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `aws eks list-clusters` | List all EKS clusters in your AWS account. |
| `aws eks describe-cluster --name <cluster-name>` | Get detailed information about an EKS cluster. |
| `aws eks update-cluster-config --name <cluster-name>` | Update the configuration of an EKS cluster. |
| `aws eks delete-cluster --name <cluster-name>` | Delete an EKS cluster. |

## EKS Configuration

You can customize the EKS cluster configuration using a YAML file or through the AWS Management Console.

**Example `eks-config.yaml`:**

```yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: my-eks-cluster
  region: us-west-2

nodeGroups:
  - name: ng-1
    minSize: 3
    maxSize: 6
    desiredCapacity: 3
    instanceTypes: ["t3.medium"]
