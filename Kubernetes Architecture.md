## Control Plane (Master Node Components)

### API Server
The API Server is the "front desk" of Kubernetes. It handles all requests to the cluster and processes them.

### etcd
etcd is the "database" of Kubernetes, storing information about the cluster, such as nodes, pods, and their statuses.

### Scheduler
The Scheduler decides which machine (Node) should run your containers, considering resource needs and constraints.

### Controller Manager
A collection of controllers that ensure the clusterâ€™s desired state matches the actual state. For example, it restarts crashed Pods.

### Cloud Controller Manager
This component interacts with cloud providers (like AWS or Azure) to handle tasks such as load balancers and persistent storage.

## Worker Node Components

### kubelet
The kubelet ensures containers on the node are running and healthy.

### kube-proxy
kube-proxy manages network communication between Pods and external clients, routing traffic efficiently.

### Container Runtime
The software that runs containers. Popular options include Docker and containerd.

## Other Components

### Pod
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers.

### Service
Provides a stable "address" for Pods, allowing reliable communication between application parts.

### Volume
A way to attach storage to a Pod for persistent data.

### Namespace
A method to divide resources among teams or projects, like folders on a computer.

### Ingress
Manages external access to services, controlling how HTTP and HTTPS traffic is routed.

## Key Features of Kubernetes

### Self-Healing
Kubernetes automatically replaces and reschedules containers if they crash or fail.

### Load Balancing
Distributes traffic across Pods to ensure high availability and reliability.

### Scalability
Easily scale applications up or down based on demand.

### Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks
Kubernetes can update applications without downtime and revert changes if something goes wrong.

### Resource Optimization
Efficiently schedules containers to make the best use of available resources.

### Multi-Cloud Support
Works seamlessly across on-premises, public, or hybrid cloud environments.
